title: "Impact-Aware Task-Space Quadratic-Programming Control"
excerpt: "We enable swift robot motion without fearing impacts with the environment. For instance in a box manipulation task, the robot does not need to stop or use close-to-zero velocity to establish contacts.

As a model-based approach, the quadratic-programming controllers need to preview the state jumps due to the impacts.
