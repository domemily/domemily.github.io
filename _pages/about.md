I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://lvchen.wixsite.com/automan/people) advised by [Prof. Chen Lv](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00161). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), working with [Prof. Jia Pan](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/jpan). I received my Ph.D. degree and Master degree in Marine Science and Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyong Liu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/liumingyong) and [Prof. Xingguang Peng](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/xgpeng). I was a Joint Ph.D. student at the Intelligent Computational Engineering Laboratory [ICE LAB](https://icelab.uk), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, the University of Strathclyde, UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Edmondo Minisci](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/minisciedmondodr/#contact).
